If you even care, take a read inside config.json, these symbols are to be typed with an escape sequence;
I.e. if your settings are 

"noun": "*",
"adjective": "#",
"verb": "^",
"preposition": "@",

to build a sentence such as; "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog".
it would be written: "\\@\\#\\#\\\*\\^ed\\@\\@\\#\\\*".

future me: uh idk, use the escaping mechanism to tense words, such as \\^p could be "past-tense verb"
